## Description

This project demonstrates the usage of AWS Boto3 library in Python to interact with an S3 bucket.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- AWS CLI installed and configured (optional)

## Installation

   cd project
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

5. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration
